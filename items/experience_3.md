### What was it that you did?

Volunteer in the nursing home

### When did you do it?

2017 October to 2018 April

### What was good about it?

Community service is also an opportunity to reflect the value of life.

### What was your favourite memory of it?

I spend an afternoon there every week and integrate into a small family. While serving them, I am also learning from their life experiences and understanding the changes in Canada over the decades.

### What didn't you enjoy about it?

I also made some mistakes on some issues. For example, taking pictures is not allowed inside nursing homes, even with the consent of the elderly. The staff warned me that it was severe for me to violate some of the bottom lines, so they asked me to delete all the pictures related to the portrait rights.

### Give your experience a letter "grade."
