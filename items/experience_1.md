### What was it that you did?

Memorizing words while drinking coffee at Tim Hortons

### When did you do it?

Probably June 6 in 2016

### What was good about it?

Studying in public places can enter a state of learning. Of course, coffee is also very refreshing and can improve work efficiency.

### What was your favourite memory of it?

When I first came to Canada, I could not communicate in languages. So if I wanted to buy something during that time, I would show it to the clerk. "I want **this** **this** and **this**, thank you!"

### What didn't you enjoy about it?

Because learning new knowledge is always painful, I am often angry about why I can't remember.

### Give your experience a letter "grade."

B, I feel that this experience is not the last time for me; after all, I am in the process of learning.
