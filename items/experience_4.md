### What was it that you did?

Mental health issues

### When did you do it?

June 14, 19

### What was good about it?

In the past, when I was in a bad mood, I used to be forced to endure. For the first time, I received treatment at the university and met with a psychiatrist.

### What was your favourite memory of it?

I can't say the most interesting, but it can be said to be the most unforgettable. Because at that time, I was just like a neuropathy. I couldn't sleep for a whole week. Even if I drank some coffee, tea, or vodka, it didn't work. I felt that my will could be so strong and not affected by external factors for the first time.

### What didn't you enjoy about it?

During that time, I couldn't control my thoughts and even feared death. So when I walked to the balcony, there was always an urge to jump off.
