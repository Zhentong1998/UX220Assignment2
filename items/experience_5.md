### What was it that you did?

Gunfighting game lovers often play ranking and team competitions.

### When did you do it?

I have been playing this game(Crossfire) for ten years, and I still participate in competitions occasionally.

### What was good about it?

Gunfighting games can exercise reaction, control, coordination and anticipation.

### What was your favourite memory of it?

I once entered the top 100 servers in the Americas in the tenth season. The joy at the time was that I would show off my friends when I saw them.

### What didn't you enjoy about it?

As age increases, energy and ability levels decline. It is no longer possible to headshot-kill the opposing player with a reaction speed of 0.3s. Instead, it is more dependent on tactics and actual combat experience.

### Give your experience a letter "grade."
