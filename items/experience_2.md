### What was it that you did?

Chasing goose

### When did you do it?

Summer 2017

### What was good about it?

After learning new common sense, wild animals in Canada are also protected by law.

### What was your favourite memory of it?

In high school, there was always a flock of geese on the lawn in front of the door. Every time I tried to chase them when I made them anxious, they started chasing me in turn. So my friends will always suffer at this time, and they will also be scared to escape everywhere.

### What didn't you enjoy about it?

In the future, as long as I try to get close to the geese, my friends will stop or warn me, and my happiness is gone.

### Give your experience a letter "grade."

C, only myself is okay, but it will affect the people around me.
